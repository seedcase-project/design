# Cross-cutting concepts

## Privacy

The Seedcase Product itself does not contain any data that requires
considering privacy concerns. However, Seedcase will be used to manage
data and has two main privacy concerns: privacy related to the data that
is entered into the Data Resource; and privacy with the people working
on a subset of the data from the Data Resource handled by Seedcase (the
data project).

The Seedcase Product will allow setting up multiple layers of user
access and authorization levels to the Data Resource instance. As
default there will be an administrator who will have access to
everything to do with user roles and permissions. In principle it should
be possible for that user to set Seedcase up in a way that they
themselves cannot view any of the uploaded data, but this will not be a
standard setup.

The database back end will hold all information about users and their
permissions. This is done by allowing the administrator to assign an
individual user to either roles or groups, some of which will come
pre-defined. It should also be possible for an administrator to create
their own roles and groups based on the people working on a particular
project that is using the Seedcase Product to handle their data.

The Seedcase Product will ship with the following user roles pre-defined
to make it easier for the data project administrator to ensure the
security and privacy of the data entered into the system.

-   **Administrator**: Initial user, will as a standard be assigned
    permissions to do everything in the database. Create, read, update,
    and delete (CRUD) permissions on data, database objects, and users
    (including assigning other users to Administrator role).

-   **Administrator light (CRUD of data)**: A user assigned this role
    will have full CRUD permission on data, but not on user permissions,
    tables, or other database objects.

-   **Views only**: Likely to be a way of connecting specific users with
    specific views created on the data contained in the database. These
    views would be created by someone with a type of administrator role.

-   **Data create-update**: A user with permission to enter data, and to
    view the data that they have entered in the past.

-   **DBMS viewer (read of data and database structure)**: Role for data
    managers who would like to connect to the database using a Database
    Management System. The role will allow for a DBMS to view the
    structure of the database as well as the data in the tables.

There will be other pre-defined roles, but those will be for the
interaction between the back end and front end and mainly coded into the
APIs. The above roles should be used by activated users.

## Legal

Seedcase will have the MIT license (see the section on [Why choose a MIT
License](/design/decisions/why-license/) for more info). We will also be
using a Developer Certification of Origin (DCO) for anyone developing
and submitting code from outside the core project team. This will be
implemented using [GitHub App DCO](https://github.com/apps/dco). The
licence text itself is available
[here](https://developercertificate.org).

### Compliance with data regulations

There are a number of legal requirements when working with and storing
research data containing person-identifiable data. There are two ways
that the Seedcase Product can help a research team to comply with the
regulations. The first is storage of data, the second is the limiting
access to data for employees.

### Storing the data

The Seedcase Product is designed to sit in two containers. The first is
the front end which contains the user interface as well as the API layer
(see section on C4 design). This container is designed to sit either on
a researchers own machine, or on a webserver hosted by the organisation
employing the researcher. The second is the back end which contains the
database and a file storage area. This second container is meant to sit
on a secure server environment with access controlled by the
organisations IT department. Only the back end container will hold the
research data.

+TODO - Do we have anything about how the front end container
communicates with the back end that can be referenced here?

The back end container will have a very limited amount of ports
available, and should only allow communication from the front end
container.

### Limiting access to data

The Seedcase Product is designed with a default set of user roles which
makes it possible to limit access to research data to the people who are
set up as administrators (a role the seedcase team envisions will only
be given to one or two people, at most the core members of the research
team). Any other role with read access to the data will only be able to
see aggregated information about the content of the ressource data.

The Seedcase Product will also allow the initial user (administrator) to
create their own user roles. This should prevent that use case where a
large group of people are assigned as administrators because they need
to view a single table.

## Logging and Monitoring

The Seedcase Product will be designed in a way that will allow the administrator to not only control who has access to the ressource data but also allow them to monitor who changes what data and when.  We want to make it easy to show which version of data is current, and what the changes are that have been made and when.  

There are two main types of data that can be changes.  The first is the local data dictionary where the Ressource will store information about the data it contains.  We envision that suggested changes to this data will be handled by a combination of the database and GitHub.  

The second type of data is the actual research data.  We propose that the Seedcase Product is set up with the option to record against each row of data who the user that created the row is, and when it was done.  We will then make it an option to engage the monitoring of various parts of the data, in a way that will allow the administrator to see which data items have been changed, when the change was made and which user effected the change.  This will be done using a set of audit tables that the database will write to when accepting a change to a data item.

## Multiple domain-specific standards

One of the core ideas for the Seedcase Project is to make it easy for researchers to handle data in a way that will allow them to share that data later on based on the FAIR principles.  To that effect Seedcase will incorporate several domain-specific standards for naming conventions.  The first to be considered should be an open source standard, but later itterations may use some that are slightly more restricted (like SNOMED where the host organisation may have a subscription).

The standard should be able to help with naming and defining the variables that the research team needs in order to build their database.  It should also be acknowledged by one or more open source data storage areas to help facilitate the Re-use aspect of the FAIR principles.
