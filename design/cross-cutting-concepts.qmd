## Privacy

The Seedcase Product itself does not contain any data that requires
considering privacy concerns. However, Seedcase will be used to manage
data and has two main privacy concerns: privacy related to the data that
is entered into the Data Resource; and privacy with the people working
on a subset of the data from the Data Resource handled by Seedcase (the
data project).

The Seedcase Product will allow setting up multiple layers of user
access and authorization levels to the Data Resource instance. As
default there will be an administrator who will have access to
everything to do with user roles and permissions. In principle it should
be possible for that user to set Seedcase up in a way that they
themselves cannot view any of the uploaded data, but this will not be a
standard setup.

The database back end will hold all information about users and their
permissions. This is done by allowing the administrator to assign an
individual user to either roles or groups, some of which will come
pre-defined. It should also be possible for an administrator to create
their own roles and groups based on the people working on a particular
project that is using the Seedcase Product to handle their data.

The Seedcase Product will ship with the following user roles pre-defined
to make it easier for the data project administrator to ensure the
security and privacy of the data entered into the system.

- **Administrator**: Initial user, will as a standard be assigned
  permissions to do everything in the database. Create, read, update,
  and delete (CRUD) permissions on data, database objects, and users
  (including assigning other users to Administrator role).

- **Administrator light (CRUD of data)**: A user assigned this role
  will have full CRUD permission on data, but not on user permissions,
  tables, or other database objects.

- **Views only**: Likely to be a way of connecting specific users with
  specific views created on the data contained in the database. These
  views would be created by someone with a type of administrator role.

- **Data create-update**: A user with permission to enter data, and to
  view the data that they have entered in the past.

- **DBMS viewer (read of data and database structure)**: Role for data
  managers who would like to connect to the database using a Database
  Management System. The role will allow for a DBMS to view the
  structure of the database as well as the data in the tables.

There will be other pre-defined roles, but those will be for the
interaction between the back end and front end and mainly coded into the
APIs. The above roles should be used by activated users.

## Legal

Seedcase will have the MIT license (see the section on [Why choose a MIT
License](/design/decisions/why-license/) for more info). We will also be
using a Developer Certification of Origin (DCO) for anyone developing
and submitting code from outside the core project team. This will be
implemented using [GitHub App DCO](https://github.com/apps/dco). The
licence text itself is available
[here](https://developercertificate.org).

### Compliance with data regulations

There are a number of legal requirements when working with and storing
research data containing person-identifiable data. There are two ways
that the Seedcase Product can help a research team to comply with the
regulations. The first is storage of data, the second is the limiting
access to data for employees.

### Storing the data

The Seedcase Product is designed to sit in two containers. The first is
the front end which contains the user interface as well as the API layer
(see section on C4 design). This container is designed to sit either on
a researchers own machine, or on a webserver hosted by the organisation
employing the researcher. The second is the back end which contains the
database and a file storage area. This second container is meant to sit
on a secure server environment with access controlled by the
organisations IT department. Only the back end container will hold the
research data.

<!-- TODO: How does the front end communicate to the backend? -->

The back end container will have a very limited amount of ports
available, and should only allow communication from the front end
container.

### Limiting access to data

The Seedcase Product is designed with a default set of user roles which
makes it possible to limit access to research data to the people who are
set up as administrators (a role the seedcase team envisions will only
be given to one or two people, at most the core members of the research
team). Any other role with read access to the data will only be able to
see aggregated information about the content of the ressource data.

The Seedcase Product will also allow the initial user (administrator) to
create their own user roles. This should prevent that use case where a
large group of people are assigned as administrators because they need
to view a single table.

## Logging and monitoring

The Seedcase Product will allow the administrator to control who has
access to the resource data as well as allow them to monitor who changes
what data and when. Part of creating and managing data that is
transparent, rigorous, and FAIR is with keeping a changelog and tracking
versions.

Logging is done on both data, metadata, and user activities parts.
Through logging, admin users will be able to monitor the Data Resource.

1. Data: The actual (research) data that is entered into the database
   or saved as raw files. Logging tracks which data records are added,
   deleted, or modified, when the change was made, and which user did
   the change. This is done as audit tables that the database will
   write to when accepting a change to a data record, which are
   built-in capabilities of most modern SQL database technology. By
   using the logs, admin users will be able to monitor activity on the
   data.

2. Metadata: This includes metadata on the data projects and the data
   dictionary for the Data Resource. Logging on these metadata will be
   handled with a combination of Git and capabilities of the database.

3. User activities: This is specific to admin users or users with
   access to parts of the database. Activities include changes to user
   roles and permissions.

## Multiple domain-specific standards

One of the core ideas for Seedcase is that it makes it easier for
researchers to handle data in a way that will allow them to share that
data later on based on the FAIR principles. Part of FAIR data is also in
how variables are named. There are a few domain-specific
standards/conventions for variable naming that Seedcase will
incorporate. Open standards will be prioritized first, and maybe later
we will incorporate the slightly more restricted standards (like
[SNOMED](https://www.snomed.org/) if the host organisation may have a
subscription). Standards help with naming and defining the variables
that the research team needs in order to build their database, so are
important to consider how they will be used.

## Computational and storage locations

Considering that Seedcase aim is to simplify structuring and working
with data, we need to clarify and consider that the locations where data
stored and where data is analyzed may be different. These are the
possible combinations described in @tbl-data-analysis-locations.

| Storage | Analysis         |
|---------|------------------|
| Server  | Same server      |
| Server  | Different server |
| Server  | Local            |
| Local   | Local            |
| Local   | Server           |

: Potential combinations where data is stored vs where analysis is done.
'Local' would be the computer itself, while 'server' is an external set
of computers (online or connected internally).
{#tbl-data-analysis-locations}

If the data owners are the same people as the data analysts (for
instance, within a research group), the data and analysis location could
be the same. If the data analysts are external to the owners, the
locations will likely be different. The consequences of these different
combinations is that we need to design Seedcase to be flexible to these
scenarios.

## Dissemination

Seedcase would be a tool that is easy to install for researchers or
institution. The official Seedcase image will be published on docker hub
website: https://hub.docker.com/. All the users will able to directly download
the Seedcase docker image and follow the simple guide to install the
seedcase at your computer or server.

### Prerequisites

Before you can install and run our Docker image, you'll need to have the
Docker Engine installed on your machine. You can download and install Docker
Engine from the official Docker website: https://www.docker.com/

### Installation Steps

Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
Pull the most recent Seedcase Docker image from Docker Hub by running the
following command:

`docker pull seedcase`

Once the Docker image is downloaded, run it with the following command:

`docker run -d -p 8080:8080 seedcase`

This command will start the Docker container in detached mode, which means it
will run in the background.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the
application running inside the Docker container.
