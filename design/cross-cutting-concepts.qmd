# Cross-cutting concepts

## Privacy

The Seedcase Product itself does not contain any data that requires
considering privacy concerns. However, Seedcase will be used to manage
data and has two main privacy concerns: privacy related to the data that
is entered into the Data Resource; and privacy with the people working
on a subset of the data from the Data Resource handled by Seedcase (the
data project).

The Seedcase Product will allow setting up multiple layers of user
access and authorization levels to the Data Resource instance. As
default there will be an administrator who will have access to
everything to do with user roles and permissions. In principle it should
be possible for that user to set Seedcase up in a way that they
themselves cannot view any of the uploaded data, but this will not be a
standard setup.

The database back end will hold all information about users and their
permissions. This is done by allowing the administrator to assign an
individual user to either roles or groups, some of which will come
pre-defined. It should also be possible for an administrator to create
their own roles and groups based on the people working on a particular
project that is using the Seedcase Product to handle their data.

The Seedcase Product will ship with the following user roles pre-defined
to make it easier for the data project administrator to ensure the
security and privacy of the data entered into the system.

-   **Administrator**: Initial user, will as a standard be assigned
    permissions to do everything in the database. Create, read, update,
    and delete (CRUD) permissions on data, database objects, and users
    (including assigning other users to Administrator role).

-   **Administrator light (CRUD of data)**: A user assigned this role
    will have full CRUD permission on data, but not on user permissions,
    tables, or other database objects.

-   **Views only**: Likely to be a way of connecting specific users with
    specific views created on the data contained in the database. These
    views would be created by someone with a type of administrator role.

-   **Data create-update**: A user with permission to enter data, and to
    view the data that they have entered in the past.

-   **DBMS viewer (read of data and database structure)**: Role for data
    managers who would like to connect to the database using a Database
    Management System. The role will allow for a DBMS to view the
    structure of the database as well as the data in the tables.

There will be other pre-defined roles, but those will be for the
interaction between the back end and front end and mainly coded into the
APIs. The above roles should be used by activated users.

## Legal

Seedcase will have the MIT license (see the section on [Why choose a MIT
License](/design/decisions/why-license/) for more info). We will also be
using a Developer Certification of Origin (DCO) for anyone developing
and submitting code from outside the core project team. This will be
implemented using [GitHub App DCO](https://github.com/apps/dco). The
licence text itself is available
[here](https://developercertificate.org).
