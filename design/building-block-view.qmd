title: Building block view
---

This document describes the core parts of the software, what each of the
"building blocks" are for Seedcase and how they connect and interact
with one another. This is the "blueprint" for the design of Seedcase, so
it is more detailed than the other design documents but not so detailed
as to be describing actual code. To clarify how much detail each part
will be described in, there are two established terms we use:

-   Whitebox: {{< var design.whitebox >}}
-   Blackbox: {{< var design.blackbox >}}

The [first section](#level1) covers the overall view of the main parts
inside Seedcase. The [second section](#level2) goes deeper and describes
the contents within each main part, but only as blackboxes.

## Whitebox overall system, Level 1 {#level1}

This section is a high level overview of the internals of Seedcase, and
is visually represented with the ["C4
Container"](https://c4model.com/#ContainerDiagram) diagram below. Each
part within the diagram is a blackbox representation of the core
internal parts of Seedcase.

Seedcase.](images/container.png)

| Building Block                 | Description                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Web Interface                  | User Interface as a web portal for interacting with the Seedcase-managed Data Resource.       |
| User Authentication            | Managing and controlling who gets access to what sections of the Data Resource.               |
| User and Data Management Layer | The programmatic layer connecting the web interface to the back end environment.              |
| Back End Environment           | This enclosed environment contains the inputted data, admin details, changelog, and raw data. |
| External Secure Server         | The external server where requested data is sent to (if needed).                              |

: Core internal parts of Seedcase (as blackboxes).

This list describes the individual blackbox parts in more detail:

-   Web Interface: This is the interface that users will interact with,
    displayed as HTML pages. Different sections of the Web Interface are
    available to different users depending on their permission level
    (for instance, admin users will see more pages related to managing
    data projects).
-   User Authentication: This is the part that handles authenticating
    users who log into the Web Portal of the Data Resource instance
    managed by Seedcase. Depending on the user's assigned permissions,
    they will see different pages within the Web Interface.
-   User and Data Management Layer: This is the programmatic interface
    that connects the Web Portal to the Back End Environment. While all
    actions will be achieved through the Web Portal, advanced users will
    be able to directly connect to this layer (for instance, through the
    terminal, Python, or R).
-   Back End Environment: This enclosed environment will contain the
    database and file storage for the Data Resource. Raw data will be
    stored here, as well as administrative data files such as a listing
    of the data projects.
-   External Secure Server: This external system is where requested data
    will be sent to depending on needs of the user.
