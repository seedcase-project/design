# Why business logic is important when working with data

## What is business logic and why is it important

- rules governing what happens in a work setting
- may tell you what should happen and when
- formal and informal rules
-- formal: how to submit expenses, how to book holiday
-- informal: ways of communicating with colleagues, who should fill up the coffee machine etc

## Business logic and data

- futureproof the collected data
- worth spending some time thinking about what may be interesting to know in a years time
- may not need it for smaller projects
- can be fitted retrospectively, but it gets harder the longer it goes on with a 'happy go lucky' approach

What is always worth recording in the data ressource:
- what data is recorded
- how is it recorded
- who records it

If in use, what should always be documented outside the system
- automation / calculation of certain values
-- eg automatically setting a review date n days after the latest review
