## Applying for data from the Data Resource

### Existing data project

The owner of an existing data project can submit additional applications
for extra data variables throughout the life-cycle of the data project.
This is done by logging into the front end of the seedcase Data Resource
and accessing the project. If the project is not archived there will be
an option to 'add variables to the project'. This is done by giving
access to the data dictionary in selection mode so that the researcher
is able to tick any additional variables they may need. The data
resource owner may want/need a reason for the application, and it should
be possible to add such to the application before submitting it.

### New data project

A researcher with the correct permissions can apply for data from the
Data Resource at any time. This can be done in two ways, either via
exploring the data dictionary and putting together an application based
on the variables identified there, or by cloning the variable list of an
existing project and adding a new application to a modified version of
this. The application is then submitted to the owner of the seedcase
Data Resource for consideration. It should be possible for the data
owner to modify the application form to comply with local regulations
and legal requirements in terms of which additional fields (apart from
the variable list), may be required.
