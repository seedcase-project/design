### Dissemination of framework

TODO: not sure where to put this.

To be aligned to the goals of openness, transparency, and FAIR
principles, the complete development of the framework will take place
openly on GitHub. From there we will link to and promote it through
various outlets, including publications, conferences, and social media.
The framework and all its components will be licensed under permissive
copyright licenses like the MIT License for the software and the
Creative Commons Attribution License for non-software content.
