Administrators and data controllers would largely interact with the web
portal for managing and overseeing ongoing projects, approve access for
new researchers, and approve projects requesting access to data.
Approving new researchers would grant the researchers access permissions
to enter the User 2 portal.

TODO: Directed graph diagram showing pathways actions take from admin
action to end result.
