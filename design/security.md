# Security, privacy, and legality

The framework itself does not contain any personal data. When the
framework is deployed as an infrastructure for a database, only
aggregate statistics, and not individual-level personal data, would be
publicly accessible. Any personal data would be stored on a secure
server that is decided and controlled by User 4, who would be
responsible for complying with relevant legal requirements.

For data transfers of personal data, either from data collection
centers, data generated from researchers, or when transferring data for
approved projects, we would use well-established and compliant encrypted
data transfer processes. Key authentication principles such as
two-factor authentication and OAuth (open standard for access
authentication) will be central to the framework to control who can
update or transfer the data. The endpoint of the data transfer is dealt
with by the legal teams of the relevant institutions.
