## Users

The four users and their associated use cases are:

1.  **User 1**: Those *inputting data*, e.g., authorized centers and
    researchers. The use cases are:
    1.  Authorized centers (GPs and hospitals) upload standardized and
        routine data through the data entry web portal.
    2.  Authorized researchers upload generated data from completed
        projects. Non-standardized data is manually processed and
        cleaned before entering into the database.
2.  **User 2**: Those *requesting access*, e.g., researchers and
    clinicians. Use cases are:
    1.  Interested researchers browse the catalogue of available data
        and the data dictionary.
    2.  Researchers request access to data by submitting a description
        of their proposed project and selecting the relevant data from
        the catalogue. This request is sent to a list of projects to
        await approval from the data controllers (User 4).
3.  **User 3**: Those *viewing updates on findings and results* such as
    aggregate statistics, e.g., policymakers, healthcare workers,
    journalists, researchers, and the general public. Use cases are:
    1.  Users view and read through the list of completed, ongoing, and
        proposed projects that use the database.
    2.  Users access and view aggregate statistics and the latest
        published findings that are relevant to them/their practice.
4.  **User 4**: Administrators and data controllers. Use cases are:
    1.  Approve newly submitted projects that request data and manage
        existing projects.
    2.  Approve and authorize researchers to access the web portal for
        data requests and to manage current authorized researchers.
    3.  Manage collection centers' access and authorization.
