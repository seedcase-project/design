title: "Standardisation tools to support team workflow"
description: "When creating a piece of software like Seedcase there are a lot of things that it would be a good idea to either standardise, or to avoid having to type up again and again. Templates and code snippets are some of the tools available to deal with these challenges."

## Context and Problem Statement

When working together with other people on a project it is easy to get bogged down in the 'how' to do things rather than actually doing something.There may also be situations where a workflow will be easier if it looks the same each time you encounter it. The question here becomes:

> How do we ensure that we work most efficiently, and have all the information we need to do our job to hand, when we need it?

Not everything can be solved by standardisation, but quite a few workflows will benefit from having a standard list of items that team members can select from to homogenise contributions.

## Decision Drivers

As we have expanded the team it has become increasingly clear that we need some more standardised ways of dealing with some of the issues that a team of people encounter when working on a shared project. There are for instance a number of things that we need to have present when reviewing pull request, or merging branches. 

## Considered Options

### Templates

Templates helps with streamlining workflows, where implemented they enforce certain requirements regarding the information needed for a workflow to commence, and they help with ensuring that all the data needed to make a decision is present. Templates can be used in many areas, we have (for now) focused on implementing them in the GitHub workflows.  We are focusing on setting up templates for creating issues, and at the other end submitting pull requests. In between we are recommending an extension for commits (Conventional Commits) which guides you through submitting a commit with more sensible comments. 

### Project pages on GitHub

It is debatable whether or not the project pages on GitHub is a tool for standardising workflows. Here we have included a brief description, further information on how we expect to use it is detailed on this page.

<!--TODO Insert link to page once it is created-->

We use the project pages to track the issues that are being worked on each month (sprint), and to some degree use it to move issues between people associated with the project, so that we all know who is working on what and when.

Should we have a section on Devcontainers and extensions here?

## Decision Outcome

There won't be any decisions made for now on whether or not to use the above mentioned ways of working. Instead we will be implementing (and have been implementing) them over the coming months, and testing out which works for us, and which will slowly stop being used and therefore turn out not to be something that is ideal for the Seedcase team.
