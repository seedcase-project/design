title: "Standardisation tools to support team workflow"
description: "When creating a piece of software like Seedcase there are a lot of things that it would be a good idea to either standardise, or to avoid having to type up again and again.  Templates and code snippets are some of the tools available to deal with these challenges."

## Context and Problem Statement

When working together with other people on a project it is easy to get bogged down in the 'how' to do things rather than actually doing something.  There may also be situations where a workflow will be easier if it looks the same each time you encounter it.  The question here becomes:

> How do we ensure that we work most efficiently, and have all the information we need to do our job to hand, when we need it?

Not everything can be solved by standardisation, but quite a few workflow will always benefit from having a standard list of items that must be present before the next step in the process is initialised.

## Decision Drivers

As we have expanded the team it has become increasingly clear that we need some more standardised ways of dealing with some of the issues that a team of people encounter when working on a shared project.  There are for instance a number of things that we need to have present when reviewing pull request, or merging branches.  A number of these challenges can be overcome by setting standards for how we present data, and how we hand tasks over internally within the team.
