### Middle-layer: The API

Modern web and computational infrastructures are built on web APIs. Any
modern online resource or interface makes use of an API, such as from
Google, Gen3, or the UK Biobank. An API is a mechanism by which
different programs can communicate with one another. They form a set of
instructions or conventions that allow easy communication between a user
and the computer. APIs by their nature are transparent and if
well-documented would ensure the linked data would be FAIR, safely and
securely.

In this case, the API would be between the user and the web server that
stores the underlying database and documentation. The API would be a
combination of a predefined set of instructions that are sent to the web
server to run certain commands as well as a set of explicit conventions
and rules on how files and folders are structured and named. Taken
together, this API would allow other software like R packages to be
built to interact with the backend to automate tasks done by the users.
