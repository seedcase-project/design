### Frontend interface: The web portal

This interface is what all users interact with and use, with essentially
three "permission" levels available:

1.  Full access: User 4.
2.  Authorized access:
    1.  User 1: A data upload portal that accepts either the routine,
        known data or new, unknown data from User 2.
    2.  User 2: A data request portal that allows the user to select
        variables in the catalogue of data as well as write and submit
        project proposals for access.
3.  Public access: User 3 would have access to all public pages, which
    includes the data dictionary, updates on findings, list of current
    and past projects, and a log of any changes or additions to the
    data.

All content would be rendered directly as plain HTML text to ease use of
existing webpage translation services (e.g. Google Translate), so that
content written in another language, i.e., Danish, would still be
readable to non-native speakers. This would also lower the amount of
maintenance necessary for documentation.
