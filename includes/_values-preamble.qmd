Any human creation is influenced by our values and perspectives of the
world around us. We can let these values guide us in our work on
Seedcase Project unconsciously and implicitly, without examining,
critiquing, and evaluating them, or we can explicitly and consciously
select, describe, and explain the values we want to be guided by.

We want to be explicit and conscious about what, how, and importantly,
why we are doing what we decide to do. Being explicit will also help
focus our work and (hopefully) make us more efficient and effective.
