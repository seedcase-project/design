These pages describe our organisation design, specifically in the design
of how we collaborate together and how work is structured.

## Values

{{< include /includes/_values-preamble.qmd >}}

-   *How* we work is as important as *what* we make or do

-   Work that is visible and open is easier to participate in, engage
    with, and contribute to

-   Openness and transparency lead to better collaboration and products

-   Being explicit is better than being implicit

-   Prescriptive methods are easier to use than descriptive ones[^1]

-   Small consistent improvements are more impactful over time than big
    irregular ones

-   Human interactions and emotions are as important as products and
    outputs

-   Investing in the future will give better outcomes than thinking too
    short-term

[^1]: An example of a descriptive approach would be describing how to
    create a folder structure for a project and possibles names for
    files while a prescriptive approach would be giving a template
    folder structure that one uses and follows.

## Principles

We have a set of principles influenced by our values for different
aspects of our work, like [teams](teams.qmd),
[collaboration](collaboration.qmd), and
[contributions](contribution.qmd). For all of them, we have these two
general principles:

-   Use established standards and practices where possible and as
    appropriate.

-   Be flexible and open to modern, newer tools or process, even when
    they aren't widely used, as long as there is a strong rationale for
    it.

## Design patterns

Design patterns common solutions to problems. We use these patterns for
how we organise ourselves and our work:

-   All content is put into GitHub repositories, the default being public
    rather than private.

-   One GitHub repository corresponds to one product and is at the root
    of the repository.

-   A project is when a team works to complete one product's "milestone"
    or "deliverable".

-   Each team works on only project at a time.
