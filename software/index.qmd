{{< include /includes/_wip.qmd >}}

## Purpose

The core purpose of writing this architecture documentation is to be
able to describe to ourselves and others what the Seedcase framework is
aiming to accomplish and how it will do that.

We structured the software architecture documentation to follow the
[arc42](https://arc42.org) template and the [C4
Model](https://c4model.com/) as much as is relevant for our situation,
since these both are fairly popular and common templates to use. This
documentation is also continuously evolving as we learn, test, develop,
and grow as a team.

## Reader

The assumed readers are similar to the ones we listed in the [Design of
Seedcase](../index.qmd) landing page. The complete list of expected
readers is found in the [Stakeholders](introduction.qmd#stakeholders)
section of the Introduction.

## Section overview

1.  [Introduction and goals](introduction.qmd): Targeted at any reader.
    Introduction to the architecture documentation, goals, core
    functionality requirements, and stakeholders (readers of the
    documentation).
2.  [Values and principles](principles.qmd): Targeted at any reader.
    Covers the core values and guiding principles that direct and shape
    many aspects of the architecture of Seedcase software as well as the
    exact implementation of the architecture.
3.  [Constraints](constraints.qmd): Targeted at any reader. Covers
    barriers or constraints we have self-imposed (for instance, due to
    ideological or philosophical reasons) as well as those we have no
    control over (such as technological server environments that
    Seedcase software may be installed on).
4.  [Context and scope](context.qmd): Targeted at any reader. Defines
    the boundaries of the Seedcase framework by listing its human and
    computer communication partners, and describing, in general terms,
    the messages exchanged between them.
5.  [Solution strategy](solution-strategy.qmd): Targeted at any reader.
    Describes our proposed solution for the problem we are trying to
    address, as well as which core technologies and architecture designs
    we will use for the solution.
6.  [Building block view](building-block-view.qmd): This is the most
    detailed section. The first part (Level 1) is targeted at readers
    who are more interested in some more technical details while later
    sections are much more highly detailed and written for those with
    much more technical knowledge. We describe the core architecture of
    the Seedcase framework with increasing detail throughout the
    section, including the different parts and connections between
    parts.
7.  [Runtime view](runtime-view.qmd): Targeted at readers who are
    interested in very technical details. Covers how the different parts
    will actually interact with each other when a user uses the Seedcase
    framework.
8.  [Deployment view](deployment-view.qmd): Targeted at readers who are
    interested in very technical details.
9.  [Cross-cutting concepts](cross-cutting-concepts.qmd): Targeted at
    both technical and non-technical users. Includes concepts such as
    security, privacy, legal considerations, storage, and dissemination.
10. [Architecture decisions](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org):
    Targeted at technical readers. Covers the reasons for decisions we
    make about specific technologies or patterns used.
11. [Quality requirements](quality-requirements.qmd): Targeted at any
    reader. This section goes into more detail on the quality goals
    listed in the [introduction](introduction.qmd#quality-goals)
    section.
12. [Risks and technical debt](risks.qmd): Targeted at more technical
    readers, but includes content for non-technical readers. Describes
    potential risks with our solution, such as security risks.
