title: "Software"

These Software design documents describe our overall software design,
specifically on how the software will generally look like in the end and
our general approach to how we build and develop it.

So far, these documents include our values towards software design, described
below, and our [principles](principles.qmd), which are informed by our
values.

## Values

{{< include /includes/_values-preamble.qmd >}}

Our values, or things we believe in, direct and shape how we build our
software and are:

-   Developing software with inclusivity and accessibility in mind
    produces better, more usable software.

-   Software that is open source and uses open source tools are better
    in the long term and more likely to be used.

-   Documentation is as important as the software itself.

-   High-quality code, though partially subjective, is as important and
    valuable as software that works.

-   Transparent and clear software is easier to reason about, build, and
    use.

-   Simplicity requires more effort but makes better software.

-   Software that is built with a consideration of sustainability in the
    broad sense lasts longer and is easier to build and maintain.

-   Building software with these values makes it easier to build as a
    team and with collaborators.
