## Purpose

The core purpose of writing this architecture documentation is to be
able to describe to ourselves and others what the Seedcase framework is
aiming to accomplish and how it will do that.

## Reader

The assumed readers are similar to the ones we listed in the [Design of
Seedcase](../index.qmd) landing page. The complete list of expected
readers is found in the [Stakeholders](introduction.qmd#stakeholders)
section of the Introduction.
