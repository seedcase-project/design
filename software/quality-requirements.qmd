## Quality requirements

The architectural quality requirements are the quality attributes that the system must have. These requirements are derived from the business requirements and the constraints of the system. The quality requirements are the non-functional requirements that the system must have. For Seedcase we have sought inspiration from the [ISO 25010 standard for software quality requirements](https://iso25000.com/index.php/en/iso-25000-standards/iso-25010) as well as the [arc42 Documentation](https://docs.arc42.org/home/) sections 1.2 and 10. The ISO 25010 standard defines nine quality requirements that a software system must have. These are:


1. **Functional suitability**: The system must have the functions that the users need.
2. **Performance efficiency**: The system must have the performance that the users need.
3. **Compatibility**: The system must be compatible with other systems.
4. **Interaction Capability**: The system must be easy to use and protect against user errors.
5. **Reliability**: The system must be reliable.
6. **Security**: The system must be secure.
7. **Maintainability**: The system must be maintainable.
8. **Flexibility**: The system must be flexible.
9. **Safety**: The system must be safe and be able to protect against accidents.

In the arc42 guidance it is recommended that a project focus on between three and five of the above areas as the primary quality requirements. For Seedcase we have chosen to focus on the following:

### Functional suitability

The system must have the functions that the users need. This is one of the most important quality requirement for Seedcase. The ISO standard talks about completeness, correctness and appropriateness which are all important aspects of functional suitability. We want all Seedcase products to have all the functions that are needed to store, organise and retrieve research data. We want Seedcase to store data in a way that it stays correct, and is easy to maintain, and we want Seedcase to be have the appropriate features for the user.

### Interaction Capability

There are a lot of things covered in the ISO standard under the heading Interaction Capability. The ones we would like to initially focus on are: Learnability, Operability, Inclusivity and Self-descriptiveness.
