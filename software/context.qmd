This section establishes the system boundaries of the Seedcase framework
and situates the framework in its operational context by describing its
potential human and computer communication partners. Human communication
partners are grouped into user roles which are broadly applicable to the
entire Seedcase framework. For a detailed discussion of these user
roles, see [User Requirements](user-requirements.qmd). Whether any
computer communication partners are present for a particular Seedcase
installation depends on the specific needs or requirements of the Data
Resource managed by Seedcase.

The diagram below illustrates the interaction and the direction of
information flow between the Seedcase framework and its communication
partners.

framework.](/images/context.png)

The table below indicates, in very general terms, the nature of the
messages exchanged between the Seedcase framework and its communication
partners. Input messages are sent by a communication partner to the
Seedcase framework, while output messages are sent by the framework to a
communication partner.

| Communication partner | Input                                     | Output                                |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Data Contributor      | data                                      | data validation, upload confirmation  |
| Data Requester        | data search terms, data project request   | metadata, data extract                |
| Administrator         | user, project and data management actions | validation, confirmation              |
| External User         | project search terms                      | data project information and findings |
