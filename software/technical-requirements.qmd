This section outlines the technical requirements for the Seedcase
software from a developer point of view.

## Technical constraints

Following our [values and principles](principles.qmd), we have the
following technical constraints of the Seedcase framework:

| Constraints                                         | Background/Motivation                                                            |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux                    | Our potential users work on any of these systems, so we need to design for that  |
| Use open source software dependencies               | We will use an open license, so we need to use components that are open as well  |
| Use software that's (relatively) familiar to many   | We want others to contribute, so we need to use tools others (likely) know       |
| Integrate GDPR, privacy, and security compliance    | Our target users work with health data, so this is vital to consider             |
| Deployable to servers and locally                   | Could be used locally but mainly used on a server environment                    |
| Storage and computing may be at different locations | Where data are stored vs analyzed will likely be different, see subsection below |

## Conventions

We follow the conventions below for software development when developing
the Seedcase framework:

| Conventions                                                                                                                | Background/Motivation                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Follow standard styling (e.g., [PIP3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatting) | Coding style is vital to readability, so we follow best practices. See our [Style documentation](https://design.seedcase-project.org/style/)                                    |
| Use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) versioning                                                                               | We can utilise existing tools to handle tasks like version release and changelog generation. See our [decision post](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-semver) on this |
| Incorporate test-driven and documentation-driven development styles                                                        | Each has pros and cons, we use what works best. See the [Contributing Guidelines](https://seedcase-project.org/community/contributing)                                          |
