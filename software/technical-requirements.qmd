### Main functionality

-   **One Data Resource per Seedcase "instance"**: For users with
    multiple Data Resources, each Data Resource will be housed in a
    separate "instance" of the infrastructure framework.
-   **Upload or update data**: Input data into the Data Resource in
    batches or continuously into the backend storage, either into the
    database or as raw data files.
-   **Upload or update metadata**: When inputting data, attach metadata
    along side it.
-   **Store changes to the data in a changelog**: Track and list changes
    made to the data within the Data Resource for auditing and
    recordkeeping.
-   **Display metadata and basic information on the data in the Data
    Resource on a user interface**: So external users and users
    interested in data in the Data Resource can browse what is
    available.
-   **Provide a data access submission process**: Allow users to submit
    a data access request for data in the Data Resource, along with a
    data selection process (for instance, like a shopping cart). Submit
    a request for access as a data project that includes selected data
    and a brief reason as
-   **Store data request submissions as data projects for auditing and
    managing**: Save submissions as "data projects", where admin users
    can approve (or decline) these data projects and manage whether they
    are "ongoing", "completed", or "declined". The stored ongoing or
    completed data projects will be displayed on the web portal for
    discoverability and transparency on the subset of the Data Resource
    used.
-   **Allow for individual parts to be independently installable and
    usable**: Users might not need or want some of the functionality, so
    being able to have individual and independent parts that are usable
    on their own is necessary. These independent parts also need to be
    able to connect and work together.


## Technical constraints

| Constraints                                         | Background/Motivation                                                            |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux                    | Our potential users work on any of these systems, so we need to design for that  |
| Use open source software dependencies               | We will use an open license, so we need to use components that are open as well  |
| Use software that's (relatively) familiar to many   | We want others to contribute, so weneed to use tools others (likely) know        |
| Integrate GDPR, privacy, and security compliance    | Our target users work with health data, so this is vital to consider             |
| Deployable to servers and locally                   | Could be used locally but mainly used on a server environment                    |
| Storage and computing may be at different locations | Where data are stored vs analyzed will likely be different, see subsection below |

## Conventions

| Conventions                                                           | Background/Motivation                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Follow standard styling (e.g., [PIP3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatting) | Coding style is vital to readability, so we follow best practices                                                                        |
| Use [CalVer](https://calver.org/) versioning                          | This style is simple and easily shows the age of the software                                                                           |
| Incorporate test-driven and documentation-driven development styles   | Each has pros and cons, we use what works best. See the [Contributing Guidelines](https://seedcase-project.org/community/contributing). |
