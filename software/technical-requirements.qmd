## Technical constraints

| Constraints                                         | Background/Motivation                                                            |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Run on Windows, MacOS, and Linux                    | Our potential users work on any of these systems, so we need to design for that  |
| Use open source software dependencies               | We will use an open license, so we need to use components that are open as well  |
| Use software that's (relatively) familiar to many   | We want others to contribute, so weneed to use tools others (likely) know        |
| Integrate GDPR, privacy, and security compliance    | Our target users work with health data, so this is vital to consider             |
| Deployable to servers and locally                   | Could be used locally but mainly used on a server environment                    |
| Storage and computing may be at different locations | Where data are stored vs analyzed will likely be different, see subsection below |

## Conventions

| Conventions                                                           | Background/Motivation                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Follow standard styling (e.g., [PIP3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatting) | Coding style is vital to readability, so we follow best practices                                                                        |
| Use [CalVer](https://calver.org/) versioning                          | This style is simple and easily shows the age of the software                                                                           |
| Incorporate test-driven and documentation-driven development styles   | Each has pros and cons, we use what works best. See the [Contributing Guidelines](https://seedcase-project.org/community/contributing). |
