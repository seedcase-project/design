## Designing the application

The following is my personal and slightly erratic take on how to go about designing a tiny app with only a few options for user interaction.  I don't follow a standard template for design, rather I seem to have encountered so many througout my career that I've made my own amalgamation of quite a few.

### Initial though process

The first steps are just ruminations and internal visualisations in my own head of what I would like a given piece of software to do.  Many ideas are turned over, some practical (it needs to accept all maners of characters and respect a line break), others are more impractical (any chance of linking it up with the coffee machine in order to have the coffee ready by the time I reach the kitchen).

Once I've mentally played with the ideas for a few days I do prefer to put an old fashioned pencil to paper and start to write my ideas down.  This is the phase where my eraser is in frequent use, and I constantly tell myself that I should do this on the computer, but I have yet to find a piece of software that is as flexible as three sheets of pristinly white A4 paper and a really sharp pencil.  You can doodle with a pencil while trying to find the perfect way to expres your thoughts, you can't really do that with a keyboard.

### Actual pen(cil) to paper

For this project I ended up with two sheets of paper, one detailing what the user should be able to do, both initially and if there are later versions.  The other being a list of which functionality the app should therefore contain at various stages throughout its lifecycle.  All of this is without me actually thinking about any sort of interface, although having worked with user acceptance testing for as many years as I have, I can never be entirely free of keeping a potential interface at the very back of my mind while thinking about practicalities.  For now though, the whole project is a thing run either in jyypiter notebook or directly in the command line.
