## Context and Problem Statement

The larger a team is, the more important it becomes to keep track of who is doing what and how far they are with certain tasks. One way of creating such an overview is by using visualisation tools, which are designed to create overviews quickly. The question then becomes:

> How do we create an overview of our current and upcoming tasks which will allow not only the person working on the task to monitor progress, but also help fellow team members to see where the project is?

## Decision Drivers

As a team we have been struggling to keep track of who is completing which tasks, and how far along that work is. We have therefore agreed, that we will try to communicate this better internally within the team, not only with frequent commits and reviews, but also utilising the new project tools that GitHub are rolling out. 

## Considered Options

There are a number of free options when it comes to visualisation tools specialising in workflows (monday.com, Google Kanban, to mention a couple), but since they would all require us to export our issues log, it makes sense to work with the built in version of project visualisation that is GitHub Projects. It comes with [extensive documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects), and is fairly intuitive to set up. As well as a standard overview it allows for a layout with vertical swim lanes (Sprint Board), and gantt-like features (Roadmap). 

## Decision Outcome

We have decided to utilise the two chart options mentioned above, the Sprint Board and the Roadmap. The sprint board will be our primary way of tracking progress within the team, and the Roadmap will be an optional way for individual team members to track the time they spend on tasks. The latter should also help with learning how to estimate time spent on each task, making it easier in future to state how many issues can be resolved in each iteration.

As mentioned in our guidelines, we will be working in iteration which are generally longer than traditional sprints as we know it from the Agile framework. The idea is that the Sprint Board from GitHub will help us with this. We will set up a board for each iteration (typically around 4 weeks) during a team meeting, and then populate it together with tasks and issues that we feel fits with the overall theme of that particular iteration. It is then up to the individual team member to use the Roadmap feature if they feel it will help.
