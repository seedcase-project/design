## Creating PlantUML images

You need the Java binary for PlantUML in order to create images from the
`.puml` files. Make sure you have Java installed on your computer first.
Then download the PlantUML program by running this command in the
project root directory (`seedcase-project/`).

``` bash
mkdir bin
gh release --repo plantuml/plantuml download --clobber -p "plantuml.jar" -D bin/
```

Creating images is then done by running (again in the project root
folder of `seedcase-project/`) the command below, replacing `*` with the
`.puml` file.

``` bash
java -jar bin/plantuml.jar design/images/*.puml
```
