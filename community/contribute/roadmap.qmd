## Deliverables and milestones

Because the framework will be built with modularity in mind, where each
component could be used alone or together, nearly all the components
could be deliverables (each User by each layer). Each deliverable would
be to prototype a MVP to begin testing it, identifying bugs, getting
feedback, and establishing maintenance procedures. See Figure 3 for the
Gantt chart.
