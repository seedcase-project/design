## Sustainability

Integral to this framework is ensuring it is sustainable over the
long-term by:

1.  Integrating the development of the framework and using it in
    multiple projects at the host institution Steno Diabetes Center
    Aarhus (SDCA).
2.  Prototyping MVP to build and document maintenance procedures.
3.  Incorporating fundamental open source sustainability concepts and
    documentation such as writing a Code of Conduct and Contributing
    Guidelines and encouraging external users to contribute.
4.  Including duties for the hired personnel to contribute back to open
    source software that the framework depends on to help their, and
    indirectly the framework's, sustainability.

## Training and educational development

Usage of this framework depends on the quality of its documentation and
training material. A key concept we will use heavily is Documentation
Driven Development, where the framework's development is guided and
informed from the development of the documentation, which places
documentation as a high priority. We will also be creating and running
short workshops and tutorials that teach researchers how they can use
this framework.
