	// Place your snippets for Quarto here. 
	// Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and description. 
	// The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. 
	// Possible variables are:
	//
	// - $1 and $2 for tab stops, 
	// - $0 for the final cursor position, and 
	// - ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders
	// 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	//

	// Go to VS Code settings (Click gear icon in bottom left corner or use the shortcut Cmd+,) and search for: @lang:quarto snippets
	// Set "Tab Completion" to "On"
	// Ensure that "Show Snippets" is ticked
	// Optional: Choose where the snippets comes in the list of suggestions in the field "Editor: Snippet Suggestions"
	// 
	// How to use the code snippets:
	// After you have set the above settings, a suggestion for one of the code snippets below will pop up automatically, when
	// you start writing the prefix. Press "Enter" to insert the code snippet.

// Much the same way that words can be added to the spell-check extension.
