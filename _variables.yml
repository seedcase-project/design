design:
  closed-box: |
    A description of the external functioning and behaviour of a system that
    doesn't include *how* it works internally. For example, how the API part of
    the Seedcase framework connects and communicates with other Seedcase software 
    components, but not how the API internally makes these connections and 
    communications. "Black" implying unseen or not visible (e.g., night time).
  crud: |
    An acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These four actions are the
    core operations for data storage on computers.
  data-resource: |
    Is the research data and metadata, and any management needed, of a specific research study. 
    A Data Resource can contain multiple Data Projects.
  data-project: |
    A subset of data from a Data Resource that researchers or other analysts
    request access to use for a specific purpose. This request, when approved, 
    will result in a data extract that is sent to the Data Requester.
  installation: |
    An installation of the Seedcase infrastructure  can include all software products 
    within the Seedcase framework or only some parts of it.
    An installation can contain multiple Data Resources and multiple Data Projects.
  seedcase-framework: |
     The software products that work together to implement the core project 
     functionalities as a single conceptual unit. Specifically, this includes 
     the software products Sprout, Propagate, Flower, and Garden. 
  seedcase-products: |
    The software products of the Seedcase project collectively.
    Also called "Seedcase software" or "Seedcase software products". 
  seedcase-project: | 
    The Seedcase Project as a whole, including software, documentation, learning material, 
    as well as underpinning ideas and philosophy.
  open-box: |
    A description of the internal functioning and behaviour of a system.
    For example, how the internals of the Seedcase framework like the web frontend 
    part, the programmatic API part, and the data backend environment part interact
    with each other. Open implying transparent or visible.
