    - On different computers
- Design and architecture
- Tutorials and training
    - Basic usage
    - Advanced usage

### Culture and collaboration

- Informal side
    - blog, as we learn about things, we share, new things found
    - short training bits, how to do things
- Formal side (largely undocumented/done through other channels aka calendar, etc)
    - How we work together, where we work, how plan or coordinate
    - When we collaborate/co-work (open session and closed session?)
    - How to manage and coordinate tasks and deadlines
        
## Steps

1. How to work together effectively and optimally
    - CONTRIBUTING
        - Workflow (Github)
        - When we work together, how often
        - Which communication channels? (Discord/Slack/Zoom/etc)
    - GOVERNANCE
        - e.g. in general I'm responsible for overall plan and structure of project
        but that doesn't mean others don't get decision. We work as a team,
        each with areas of responsibilities but we all have a stake in this.
    - CODE OF CONDUCT   
        - How do we want to work together and behave.
        - How to resolve conflict.
2. How to share knowledge and skills learned and experiences (inside and outside of team) (-docs)
    - blog/*
3. Design, architecture, and technologies (-docs)
    - design.md
        - values and guiding principles
        - More detailed than the diagram and more pathways and connections
    - architecture/api.md
        - decisions/why-rest-api.md
        - decisions/why-django-or-flask.md
    - architecture/backend.md
        - decisions/why-sqlite-or-parquet.md
    - architecture/frontend.md
        - decisions/why-...

## Questions

- Name for the product
- Do we make a new GH org?
- How many repos?
    - one for product
        - including product docs, reference docs, general usage, etc
        - gh-pages/built docs as website, but not part of installation
    - one for website/docs
        - admin/contributor side? e.g. for contributing docs?
            - e.g. why we decide on certain technologies etc.
        - public side? training, tutorials, introductions, mission?
        - Where should these outlets be put, in public or admin side?
            - informal blogs...?
            - formal posts (aim to publish in zenodo, and other outlets?)

## Milestones

- Rough draft of design and architecture
- Send design and architecture to consulting firm for review?
