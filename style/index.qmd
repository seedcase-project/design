title: "Style guidelines"
---

{{< include /includes/_wip.qmd >}}

## Purpose

These documents contained within the style section are meant to provide
guidance on how to write, format, and structure documents within the
Seedcase Project. They are meant to be a guide and a reference for all
team members and contributors to make sure that we have some consistency
in development, coding, and writing across all Seedcase documentation
and software.

We assume the reader is either:

-   A new team member who uses these style documents as onboarding
    material.
-   A current team member who needs to reference the style documents for
    a specific task or as a reminder.
-   A potential or current contributor who wants to understand how we
    work and how to best contribute.
-   Other groups who want to use these documents as inspiration or to
    copy/modify for their own uses.
