## Philosophy and ideals

How we design things at the implementation level, both for internal and user-facing content, will be:

-   Simple: Keep the vocabulary simple and easy to understand
-   Composable: Can be combined with other names to imply intent
-   Predictable: Easy to guess and reason on, without needing to look up
    documentation
-   Reusable: Can be used across multiple contexts
-   Consistent: Remains the same across different contexts
-   Align with existing conventions: Follow widely-established standards
    and conventions

# Style guidelines

- Keep functions small and simple.
- Have predictable output 

for very small functions (<5 lines) and with few arguments and options and with clear input and output, only need to provide a simple docstring (or none at all)

Prefer predictable output, prefer fewer actions for most functions, bigger/core functions then contain the smaller functions that chain together to achieve a bigger/more complex set of actions
