## Context and Problem Statement

Seedcase should look good with minimal effort. Therefore, we aim to utilise existing CSS or UI frameworks instead of building from scratch.

## Decision Drivers

The UI framework should:
- Look good
- Integrate well with Figma. The wireframes in Figma should be easy to reproduce in Django templates
- Be easy to use with Django. Since Django is a Python framework, we don't want to rely on frameworks that requires node/npm or too much JavaScript. Preferably, we want a CSS framework, where CSS classes can be directly added to HTML elements
- Should have a great documentation and community

## Considered Options

I have considered the following:
- Bootstrap. The oldest and most widely used css framework. It is often used together with Django and there even exist a python package: django-bootstrap5
- Material Design. A popular framework designed by Google. The framework has multiple implementations where https://materializeweb.com/ and https://www.beercss.com/ prioritize CSS over javascript
- Tailwind. A popular framework that allows a high customisability
- Bulma. Simple CSS only framework

## Decision Outcome

We decided on "Material Design" because:
- We think it looks better than the other frameworks. Actually, this was the main driver for selecting Material Design
- Figma has great support for Material Design
- We have found two CSS frameworks, which integrates nicely with Django: https://materializeweb.com/ or https://www.beercss.com/

Reasons for not selected the other frameworks
- Bootstrap has great integration with Django, but we think Material Design looks better 
- Tailwind require time and skill to customize and it relies on nodejs/npm which gives a bad developer experinence
- Bulma is a CSS only framework. It is easy to use, but we think Material Design looks better

### Consequences

We might miss the better Django integration from Bootstrap
