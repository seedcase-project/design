## Context and Problem Statement
We want to use a cloud provider, so we can easily deploy and visualize the progress of seedcase. 

This is relevant for reviewing code changes and for manual and user-experience testing.

Ideally, this environment should be similar to a future production environment, but this may very a lot based on the team/organisation that needs to run seedcase

## Decision Drivers
We want to decide on a cloud provider based on these features/metrics
- Price
- Ease of use
- Customisability. Cloud provider should be easy to customise? 
- Github Auth. Provider should integrate with github authentication, because we already use github for the repo and project management
- Github Actions Integration. Cloud provider should integrate with have github actions so it will be easy to make pipelines
- Managed Postgres. Cloud provider should have a managed postgres database to store application data if needed
- "Native" support for Django application. Cloud provider should have support for running a Django application without the need to wrap it in package or docker container
- Docker image or Dockerfile support. Cloud provider should also have support for running docker images. Potentially, providing a Dockerfile would be convenient
- Logging + Alerting. Logging and alert is nice, but no so relevant for a demo environment
- Similar to production environment. We want the demo environment to be similar to the production environment, but we dont know how that will look


## Considered Options

We have considered four different cloud providers: Azure, Render, Digital Ocean and Vercel. Below you see a "decision matrix" based on the different features.

## Decision Outcome

We have decided on render.com. 

Render.com is cheap - even free for our use-case. It integrates with github auth and the deployment is very easy to setup. 

Furthermore, we can customize the solution to use a Docker image or a Dockerfile if we need to. 

The other cloud providers, where not choosen for these reasons:
- Azure is able to do everything, but it is too complicated for a demo environment
- Vercel is easy to use, but lacked customisability. For instance, it seemed not to work so well with poetry
- Digital Ocean could be a fair choice, but I was unable to make it work

### Consequences

Render.com does not understand docker-compose files which would have been nice. Azure and Digital Ocean sort of supports docker-compose files, but it would require a lot of work and this seems overkill for a demo environment
