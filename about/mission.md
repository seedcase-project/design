**Our goals for the project are:**

- To create a stand-alone fully functioning database which can be modified by any given researcher to contain the dataset (or datasets) they are working with

	- It must be built using open source technology
	- It should be able to work as a distributed model where collaborators from different geographical locations can work on the same dataset simultaneously if needed

- To build a community around the project based on the open decision framework

	- It should be open to both technical and non-technical users as well as people who would like to contribute because they think the project is an interesting challenge

- If time allows, then the core team will set up a working example of the database using the DD2 dataset in a fully distributed model, with the ability to accept input from all over Denmark as well as allowing for data analysis to be carried out by researchers approved by the [ask Annelli? who deals with approving access to the data] (you can read more about this here [link to the project summary]
