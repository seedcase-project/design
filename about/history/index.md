title: History of the project
---

This project initially formed out of a need to improve the data
infrastructure of the [Danish Centre for Strategic Research in Type 2
Diabetes (DD2)](https://dd2.dk/) study [@Christensen2018]. We expanded
it and generalized the idea to incorporate improving not only DD2, but
also the infrastructure of other Danish studies.

The NovoNordiskFonden in Denmark had an grant application call titled
*Data Science Research Infrastructure Grant* in 2021, of which we've
included a modified version of the instructions
[here](nnf-instructions.md). We submitted an
[application](nnf-application.html) for it that resulted in receiving
the requested funds.
