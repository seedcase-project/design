# Admin helper scripts

This folder contains code-based scripts to help with some administrative
tasks for contributing to and building the `seedcase-project` website.

## Installation of dependencies

For R, packages the scripts depend on are installed by opening the
`seedcase-project.Rproj` RStudio R Project file and running these
functions in the R Console:

``` r
# Install the pak package if necessary.
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```
