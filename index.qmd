::: {#hero-heading}
Design is about reducing complexity, guiding our work, and lowering our
cognitive load. These documents describe how we design our organisation,
software, and documentation.
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default"}
These pages are structured follow the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr)
reference format, with some explanation format mixed in. Explanations on
our design decisions are found in the
[decisions](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/) archive.

## Who you are as the reader

We've written these documents considering a few people in mind who we
think will read the documents:

-   **New contributors/team members**: The most important reason we have
    written design documentation is to quickly onboard new contributors
    or team members to the project.

-   **Research software/data engineers**: These readers will be
    interested in how we design our software and potentially our
    organisation, likely for their own purposes for learning or for
    using in their own work.

-   **Managers or leaders**: These are people that maybe be interested
    in applying what we do to their own organisation, team, or group.

-   **Research or development operations personnel**: This reader is a
    person who is interested in applying or learning from how we manage
    our operations and how streamline or automate our operational tasks.
