Many initiatives in clinical research, including the Danish Centre for
Strategic Research in Type 2 Diabetes (DD2) initiative, have a hard time
getting funds for building and maintaining needed software that make
sure health science is the highest quality it can be. For this project,
we aim to build software tools that make it easier to do better
research, especially for managing and working with data. We'll first be
building these tools to help support the DD2 initiative.

<!-- TODO: List overview of purposes here -->

We will be sharing these tools widely and freely, so that as many
research groups as possible can use it for their own projects. Not only
will we build these tools to help researchers with managing and sharing
their data, we also will create them with beginner-friendly
documentation and training material to make sure more researchers use
our tools, no matter their skill level. We believe that with these
tools, science on health and well-being can become better, ultimately
helping people with diabetes and society in general.
