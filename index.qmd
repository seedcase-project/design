::: {#hero-heading}
:::

Getting funds, finding personnel, and allocating resources to build
functioning software is very difficult in research.

Seedcase aims to ease the burden of building, managing, sharing, and
accessing health data by developing both user-friendly software to
automate or streamline these jobs as well as beginner-friendly training
material for data engineering.

We believe that with these tools and knowledge, science on health and
well-being can become better, ultimately helping people with people with
diseases like diabetes and society in general.
